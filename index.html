      <h2>Javascript Basics</h2>
      <p>Javascript is a cross-platform, object oriented scripting language.  Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
      lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.  Javascript lives inside a host environemnt (a web browser or Node server),
      it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li id="variable_declaration"><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> Javascript variables are containers for stroing data values- imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
        a variable holds a value.  All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.  These unique names are called identifiers. <div class="term_highlight">var x;</div></li>
        <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables- our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.
        The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <div class="term_highlight">var x = 10;</div></li>
        <li><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.  There are six data types that are
        JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <div class="term_highlight">true</div> or <div class="term_highlight">false;</div> null -null aka nothing; Number -42 or 3.14159; String-
        "coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array-[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']; and Object-{first_name; 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</li>
        <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks
        based on values or conditionals that have been met.  You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.  There are the following conditional statements:
        if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;</li>
        <li><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many differetn kinds of loops in every programming language, but they are essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action
        some number of times.  Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.  Thats a loop!</li>
        <li><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block.  When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions.
        As an example imagine we are putting togther a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruciton manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table
        the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
